# Introverts-vs-Extroverts-What-the-Data-Says
Tested 6 statistical hypotheses on 2,900+ participants, found significant behavioral patterns 

# **Project Overview**

### **Challenge**
Understand the key differences and analyze behavioral patterns between introverts and extroverts.
### **Objectives**
Analyze behavioral trends, compare personality-related metrics, identify correlations, and detect atypical individuals within each group.
### **Dataset & Tools**
Used the Kaggle **[Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkapilavai/extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data/data)** (2,900 rows and 8 columns).
Analysis performed in **PostgreSQL (SQL), Python (SciPy, Pandas)** and Google Sheets. Visualization created in **Tableau Public**.
### **Approach**
The project is based on hypothesis testing and comparative analysis using SQL and data visualization tools to identify key behavioral patterns between personality types.

# Conclusion

The analysis showed clear differences between extroverts and introverts. Extroverts are more active — they attend social events more often, go outside, and post more on social media. Introverts, on the other hand, spend more time alone and are more likely to feel tired after social interactions.

Both the correlation and t-test confirmed that these differences are statistically significant. There are also some people who don’t fit the pattern — social introverts and quiet extroverts — which shows that personality can’t always be explained by one label.

Overall, the project helped to understand how data can describe human behavior and how SQL with simple statistics can turn survey results into clear insights.
